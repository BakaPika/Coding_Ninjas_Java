**1st approach Observation**
-
  - Tried to use if else condition to check if the given number is odd or even and printing the odd number. **but it didn't work**

**2nd Apprach**
-
 - To print the values formula used: **(2 * rows - 1)**
 - Let n = 4
 - In the first row the values will be such 1 3 5 7 (we are iterating the value to be printed by 2 in eah col.)
    - A condition is applied where if the printed value is greater than **2*n-1** (which is greatest odd number) then value will revert back to 1
